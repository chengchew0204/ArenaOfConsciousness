# Arena of Consciousness  
**Artistic & Philosophical Project Proposal**

---

## I. Concept  

**Arena of Consciousness** is an experimental online platform where live streaming becomes an allegory for the fleeting, unstable nature of consciousness.  

In this space, anyone can initiate a live broadcast and immediately become the **dominant subject of awareness**. Yet this awareness is fragile: at any moment, another user may seize the stream, cut it off, and replace it with their own. Each live stream thus becomes a temporary fragment of consciousness—always contingent, always at risk of interruption.  

The system continuously regenerates itself through cycles of birth, interruption, and rebirth, embodying the principle of **autopoiesis**. Existence here is never static; it is produced collectively, through contestation and renewal.

## II. Philosophical Framework  

1. **Autopoiesis (Self-Generation)**  
   The platform is not defined by stable content, but by its self-sustaining process. Consciousness is enacted through the perpetual loop of streaming, interruption, and replacement.  

2. **The Finitude of Consciousness**  
   Consciousness within the platform is radically finite—its persistence depends not on the will of the self, but on the unpredictable actions of others.  

3. **Power, Thought, and Competition**  
   The dominant consciousness is not owned by any single subject. It is the thought, image, or presence that manages to persist the longest amid a field of competing forces.  

4. **Anonymity and Collectivity**  
   Every participant is stripped of stable identity, functioning instead as a neuron within a larger network. The subject is not an individual but an emergent effect of the crowd.

## III. Audience / Participant Experience  

- **Observation**  
  Upon entering, viewers see only one active stream—the current embodiment of collective awareness.  

- **Seizure**  
  Any participant can attempt to seize control, abruptly cutting off the existing stream and replacing it with their own. This act is direct and violent, echoing the struggle of ideas to dominate.  

- **Persistence**  
  To remain visible, one must survive the constant threat of interruption. Duration itself becomes a competitive achievement.  

- **Regeneration**  
  Each interruption is also a rebirth: the disappearance of one consciousness gives rise to another. The platform itself becomes a living organism, self-regenerating through conflict.

## IV. Form & Aesthetics  

- **Medium**: Web-based interactive platform (and/or gallery projection)  
- **Core Mechanism**: Single featured stream at any given moment; seizure and defense functions  
- **Visual Elements**:  
  - *Dominance Index*: A counter showing the current subject’s survival time  
  - *Neural Map*: A dynamic visualization of seizures and defenses, resembling the flickering of synaptic connections  
- **Archival Output**: A daily “Consciousness Log” automatically records the longest surviving streams and most intense struggles, serving as a living archive of collective subjectivity

## V. Artistic Significance  

1. **Challenging Digital Identity**  
   Unlike mainstream platforms that build permanent profiles, **Arena of Consciousness** erases identity, reducing subjects to ephemeral presences.  

2. **Subverting Live Streaming Culture**  
   Whereas conventional live streaming rewards continuity and accumulation, here the very possibility of duration is precarious, subject to immediate rupture.  

3. **Materializing Consciousness Philosophy**  
   Consciousness is no longer an inner, private phenomenon. It becomes visible, interruptible, and public—an event subject to external control.  

4. **A Social Metaphor**  
   The arena dramatizes the dynamics of society itself: how power, visibility, and thought contend for dominance, and how subjectivity emerges only through collective struggle.

## VI. Exhibition Mode  

- **Online Exhibition**: Open access, anyone can enter and participate  
- **Physical Installation**: Projected onto large screens in the gallery, showing the current dominant stream alongside the neural network map and consciousness logs. Visitors can use their phones to instantly seize control, collapsing the distance between viewer and participant

**Arena of Consciousness** is a generator of finite consciousness.  
It insists that:  

- Existence is a temporary condition, allowed or denied by others  
- Thought and expression are always fragile, always interruptible  
- The true subject is not the individual, but the emergent configuration of the crowd  

Here, consciousness is an arena. To survive is to compete; to vanish is inevitable.
